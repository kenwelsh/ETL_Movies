# ETL_Movies

## Challenge

The challenge.ipynb file contains a script that will perform an ETL process on three movie data files (not included in Depository due to size and issues with Git Large File Storage):
+ wikipedia.movies.json
+ movies_metadata.csv (sourced from Kaggle)
+ ratings.csv (sourced from Kaggle)
